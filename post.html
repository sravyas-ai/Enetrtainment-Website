            <h2>Artist Woo Yeonwoo</h2>
            <p>✨ My dear fans, ✨ I’ve always believed that music has the power to heal and bring peace to the heart. Lately, I’ve embraced a singing style that some say reminds them of a priest’s prayers. If my voice can bring even a moment of calm and warmth to your soul, then I will continue to sing with all my heart. Thank you for always supporting me! Let’s walk this journey together, one melody at a time. 🎶💙</p>

            <p class="comment"><strong>Music Critic’s Post:</strong> 🎤 Is Woo Yeonwoo’s Angelic Persona Just an Act? There’s no denying that Woo Yeonwoo has captivated fans with his "priest-like" singing and seemingly pure image. But is this genuine, or just a carefully crafted concept?</p>

            <p class="comment"><strong>Woo Yeonwoo's Response:</strong> People can believe whatever they want. I just sing. If that bothers some, that’s their problem, not mine. 🎤 I’m not here to prove anything—just doing what I love.</p>

            <p>Alright, science lovers! Ever wondered how my web fluid works? Let’s break it down! 🧪✨<br>
               Web fluid needs to be:<br>
               ✔ Stronger than steel (to swing between buildings).<br>
               ✔ Flexible like rubber (so I don’t snap my arms off).<br>
               ✔ Biodegradable (eco-friendly Spidey, duh).</p>
