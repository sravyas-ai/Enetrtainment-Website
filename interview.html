            <h2>GRU'S NEXT MISSION</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">In an exclusive interview with our channel, the world renowned villain and comedian Gru and his Minions went into details about their heist to hold Saturn in the palm of their hands. Albeit ending up unsuccessful, Mr. Gru claims that it has <b>“enlightened”</b> him to the glory path of absolute Villainy - <b>“Godfather of Villains”!</b><br><br>

Interviewer - What inspired you to capture Saturn? Why not aim to steal the Kohinoor diamond or the highly secret salsa recipe of the <i>Grandma of Mexico?</i><br><br>

Mr. Gru - Salsa!? I don’t like salsa anymore, in fact I hate it now. Ever since I had to sit in the toilet for the whole day after tasting one. And Kohinoor diamond? Nah, that won’t get people talking and start to worship me! That won’t get the other so-called “villains” with baby goo coming out of their nose to tremble at the sight of me! No! It should be something big and Saturn was perfect. It would make me famous and even NASA cannot stop that.<br><br>

Interviewer - That was very passionately spoken! And speaking about NASA, I heard that a spokesperson committee formed by the Minions met with and had a talk with NASA when the organisation requested you for talks and potential collaboration. Can you tell us more about that?<br><br>

Mr. Gru - Ahh, to be honest that meeting was a disaster. Well, I personally didn’t meet with them because I was arranging a party for my little girls. So basically, Kevin and the guys went and met with them and it was all going so nice and neat and comfy. Suddenly, one of the guys from NASA said they did not understand what Bob was saying and that he was repeatedly talking about banana smoothie or something. That’s a whole load of crap! Bob won the Best Spoken Minion for three years in a row now. I don’t know the details of what the argument was about before Ricky threw the apple pie on the boss guy but, the guys in NASA were very rude to us. Kevin came home and said, “Banana Banana, very rude, very rude.” If you can understand what Kevin is saying then Bob would have been as clear as the sky is right now.<br><br>

(thunder clouds rumbling somewhere)<br><br>

Interviewer - ……… Uhm. I could feel your frustration now. But the question I’m going to ask now is equally frustrating because as per your latest posts on social media, your mission wasn’t that quite …… successful.<br><br>

Mr. Gru - Well, as a villain sometimes you should accept reality.<br><br>

Interviewer - That it is impossible to get hold of Saturn?<br>

Mr. Gru - What? No! It’s that even a great scientist like Dr. Nefario can make mistakes. He actually forgot to calculate and consider the gravitational pull. Hence, we ended up in a failure with the rocket almost falling on Daniel.<br><br>

Interviewer - ………<br><br>

Mr. Gru (ignoring the interviewer) - Well, that does not stop me from being the villain of all villains - “The Godfather”. My team is taking multiple steps further now, we are going to capture the Black Hole. Louise already found a way to make the repulsion suits so that we can stand near the black hole without getting sucked into it. NASA doesn’t know this yet but I’ll make a post about next week after we are ready. Hence, the next time we meet you are not going to see Mr. Gru but the “Godfather of Villains”. See ya!<br><br>

Interviewer - Hopefully, we can meet again after you catch the Black hole. (to the audience) So alright folks, let's wish Mr. Gru and his team of Minions all the very best of luck!

            <h2>INJUSTICE TO 3 EMPLOYEES, BUT REALLY?</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">In this exclusive interview, Monkey D. Luffy, Naruto Uzumaki and Yuji Itadori meet with us to talk about their ‘ordeal’ and shed more light on the incident.<br><br>

Interviewer - We have heard about the circumstances that you were involved in that fateful day. How do you feel about everything that has happened?<br><br>

Naruto - We feel it’s very unfair that we were fired over some complaints about lunch. Isn’t it something that any company or institution always gets complained on? I really don’t see why we were treated very cruelly, as though we had committed a sin.<br><br>

Yuji - I feel the same as my dear friend Naruto here. We were treated very unfairly.<br><br>

Luffy - As far as I’m aware, we didn’t make any mistakes.<br><br>

Naruto, Yuji and Luffy say the same thing - None!<br><br>

Interviewer - Well, I understand about the food complaints but about the ‘commiting sin’ part - Ms. Nami did mention in her publicly released statement that you guys suffered from gluttony. But moving forward —<br><br>

Naruto - WHAT!?<br><br>

Yuji - That’s very rude!<br><br>
Luffy - I am not a glutton!<br><br>

(Naruto and Yuji side-glanced at Luffy and Yuji asked)<br><br>

Yuji (concerned) - Now now, do you even know what glutton means, Luffy?<br><br>

Luffy - No, I don’t.<br><br>

(Silence)<br><br>

Yuji - Well, it means that you horde – <br><br>

Interviewer (perplexed but moving on, cutting off Yuji) - Well, my next question to you all is what happened after Ms. Kugisaki asked you all to meet in her office. Mr. Buggy had explained that – <br><br>

Luffy - Why did you guys ask that red-nose clown for details? That idiot fooled me once!<br><br>

Naruto - I hate that guy!He always brag about how handsome he looks and he drones on and on about his ponytail –<br><br>

Yuji - Not only that! One time, he came towards my desk and told me that our COO, Ms. Maki had called me to her office. Of course I was new to the office and I asked red-nose for directions. So he drew me a map and I trusted the map and followed the exact directions but at the end I ended up in the garbage chute on the twentieth floor of the building!<br><br>

Luffy - Yuji, he did me even worse! That clown told me that if I call this particular number and yell at them, then I will be offered a free KFC family pack. No sane person would actually not consider such an offer. So of course he dialled the number, said a few words and gave the phone to me. And then I shouted at them saying, “YOU SUCK!”. The guy on the other side went silent and asked for my name and I said, “I am Monkey D. Luffy.” and before I could ask them about the KFC offer he cut the call. Later, sometime  before the tea break when I was reading through the menu of my favorite restaurant on my desktop wallpaper, I received a notification from the restaurant saying that I no longer will have a “Fav customer discount” anymore!! Do you know how pricey that restaurant is? It is the only place with good meat near my home!! But, well, I actually didn't realise what happened at that time and during the tea break when I shared this to Yuji and Naruto, they made me realise what happened and right when I was going to smack that snickering red- nose –<br><br>

Yuji(looking disappointed)- Well that’s when Ms. Maki came into the cafeteria and we couldn't do anything but glare at that clown.<br><br>

Naruto - You can't imagine the anger we had to go through.<br><br>

Yuji - It was very painful for us to see Luffy suffer like this.<br><br>

(Luffy sniffs slightly. Yuji and Naruto place a hand on either side of his shoulder.)<br><br>

Interviewer - I really understand how painful that must have been. But…… My actual question is what exactly happened after you guys entered Ms. Kugisaki’s office.<br><br>


Yuji - Actually nothing tbh. She told us to never step inside the building ever again.<br><br>

Naruto (who began smiling mischievously) - Nah, you missed a lot of details in between, Yuji. She actually gave us a chance but only if we wrote a letter apologizing for our ‘behaviour’—<br><br>


Luffy & Yuji (voice stronger and in union)- No way in hell we will apologize!<br><br>

Yuji- I told her bravely right to her face that she is being very unreasonable and very rude and very cruel just like that villain boss in Human Earthworm 7. That boss actually  —<br><br>

Naruto - Even that was absolute badass of you, Yuji (Yuji puffs up his chest and Luffy pats his shoulder), the main highlight was when we all told her how bad the employees are here, how bad the food was and how rude she is being to us, she got so angry at us so much that she started throwing her designer shoes at us - more specifically at Yuji and Luffy. They both caught those shoes and ran away from that hell hole. Later, I got the brilliant idea of selling these in black market and — (Naruto breaks out into a laughter along with Yuji)<br><br>

Interviewer - ………And?<br><br>

Luffy (who was laughing) - we sold them and got a profit! Then we had the best lunch of our lives!!!!<br><br>

<i>(Then they all three broke into laughter)</i><br><br>
Luffy - Oy Naruto, I didn't know you were such a genius!<br><br>

Naruto - Well I’m born a genius —<br><br>

Interviewer(who looked to have lost all the light in his life) - What are you guys doing now? Now that you have lost a job?<br><br>

Yuji- Well, at the same restaurant we had our lunch and were discussing about what happened, a man named Mr. Todo came towards us and said that we are the perfect representatives of a true employee and wit. We were very confused and asked him who he was and he said that he is part of the recruit team in the no.1 fashion powerhouse — Gojo’s fashion line -  Fashionista. So we met with Mr. Gojo the CEO and Mr. Nanami, the COO and  got hired the same day!<br><br> 

Interviewer (his eyes widening) - Wait isn't the Hammer&Nails Inc. comes under the brand name of Gojo Enterprises?<br><br>

Luffy - Yeah! <br><br>

Yuji - Ms. Designer Shoes was so shocked when she saw us the first time!<br><br>

Naruto - And later a whole drama happened, you wouldn’t believe it —<br><br>

Interviewer(interrupting, having done with their fortunate lives and his personal misfortunate life) - Well, alright folks, it has been a long interview! Let's call it quit and wish the three of them all the very best in their lives<br><br>

Luffy, Yuji and Naruto - Bye guys!!!<br><br>

            <h2>THE ALCHEMY OF MINDS!</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">Interviewer: Welcome, everyone, to this one-of-a-kind roundtable discussion featuring three of the most brilliant and controversial minds in history. Today, we have the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the legendary chemistry teacher-turned-criminal Walter White, and the infamous biotech entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes. And to make this truly legendary, moderating this panel is none other than your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.<br><br>
Spider-Man: (spins into the room, lands in a chair) Okay, wow. This is definitely the weirdest lineup I’ve ever been part of. But, uh, let’s get into it! So—<br><br>
Spider-Man: You three have changed the world forever. How does it feel to be the faces of both progress and disaster?<br><br>
Oppenheimer: (sighs deeply) I have become death, destroyer of worlds.<br><br>
Walter White: (smirks) I prefer something more personal—I am the danger.<br><br>
Elizabeth Holmes: (grinning) I just think we were really changing lives with what we did.<br><br>
Spider-Man: Uh-huh. One of you literally changed molecular science, one of you exploded an entire industry, and one of you made a fake blood test that didn’t work. Care to elaborate?<br><br>
Holmes: Okay, but we had vision. Big vision. That’s what makes a great innovator! Just like you, Spider-Man! You get it!<br><br>
Spider-Man: Ma’am, I don’t think web fluid and fraudulent medical tests are the same thing.<br><br>
Walter White: (chuckles) Honestly, kid, if she had my level of chemistry expertise, Theranos might still be running.<br><br>
Holmes: (glares) If you had my marketing skills, you wouldn’t have been caught.<br><br>
Oppenheimer: (massaging temples) This is—this is unbearable.
Spider-Man: Yeah, yeah, let’s refocus. Oppenheimer, you worked on the Manhattan Project, which literally altered the course of history. Do you think your scientific breakthroughs ultimately helped or hurt humanity?<br><br>
Oppenheimer: Science is neither good nor evil—it is a tool. I gave the world knowledge, and how they used it was out of my hands.<br><br>
Walter White: (nodding) That’s exactly how I felt about my product.<br><br>
Spider-Man: Sir. Your product was meth.<br><br>
Walter White: Blue meth. Science, my boy.<br><br>
Holmes: Honestly, same. I gave the world hope, and people just didn’t understand it.<br><br>
Spider-Man: Ma’am, your machine couldn’t even detect a cold.
Holmes: Details.<br><br>
Oppenheimer: This is the worst panel I have ever been part of.<br><br>
Spider-Man: Yeah, I should’ve called in Tony Stark for this instead. Anyway, final question—<br>
If you could give one piece of advice to future innovators, what would it be?<br><br>
Oppenheimer: Think before you act. Know the weight of your discoveries before they become irreversible.<br><br>
Walter White: Don’t get caught. And always have an exit plan.<br><br>
Holmes: Fake it ‘til you make it! (giggles) Worked for me for a while!<br><br>
Spider-Man: And that’s my cue to leave. Thanks for coming, folks! Science nerds, take notes. Or, actually, don’t—I feel like some of these lessons are… questionable.<br><br>
